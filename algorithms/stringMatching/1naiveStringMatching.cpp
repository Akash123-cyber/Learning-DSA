// Complexity Analysis of Naive algorithm for Pattern Searching:
// Best Case: O(n)
// When the pattern is found at the very beginning of the text (or very early on).
// The algorithm will perform a constant number of comparisons, typically on the order of O(n) comparisons, where n is the length of the pattern.

// Worst Case: O(n^2)
// When the pattern doesnâ€™t appear in the text at all or appears only at the very end.
// The algorithm will perform O((n-m+1)*m) comparisons, where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
// In the worst case, for each position in the text, the algorithm may need to compare the entire pattern against the text
