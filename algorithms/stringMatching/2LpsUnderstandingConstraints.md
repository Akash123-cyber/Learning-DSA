## Understanding the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) Array Constraint

The **LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array** stores the **length** of the longest proper prefix of the substring `P[0:i]` that is also a suffix. The statement **LPS[i] \leq i** means that for every index `i`, the longest such prefix-suffix pair can never be longer than `i` itself.

### Why Can't LPS[i] Be Greater Than i?
1. **LPS[i] represents a proper prefix** of `P[0:i]`, meaning it is a part of `P[0:i]` but **not** the whole substring itself.
2. By definition, a **proper prefix** of a string **excludes** the entire string.
3. Therefore, the longest prefix-suffix for `P[0:i]` can be **at most** of length `i` (but never greater).

### Clarifying the Difference in Statements
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ "LPS[i] \leq i" (Always True)
- This simply states that the longest prefix-suffix cannot be longer than `i`, which is obvious.
- Example: If we consider `P[0:5]`, its longest prefix-suffix can be **at most** length `5`, but in reality, it is always **less than or equal to 5**.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ "The longest proper prefix which is also a suffix can't be equal to the substring" (Also True)
- This means that the **proper prefix** considered in LPS **cannot** be exactly equal to `P[0:i]`, because a **proper prefix** is **strictly smaller** than the full substring.

These two statements do **not** contradict each other! The first just states an upper bound, while the second emphasizes that **equality to the full substring is never possible**.

### Example: "aaaaa"

Consider the pattern **"aaaaa"** and its **LPS array**:

```
Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
Pattern:  a  a  a  a  a  
LPS:      0  1  2  3  4  
```

| Index (`i`) | Substring `P[0:i]` | Proper Prefix-Suffix | LPS[i] |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| 0 | "a" | No proper prefix | **0** |
| 1 | "aa" | "a" (prefix = suffix) | **1** |
| 2 | "aaa" | "aa" (prefix = suffix) | **2** |
| 3 | "aaaa" | "aaa" (prefix = suffix) | **3** |
| 4 | "aaaaa" | "aaaa" (prefix = suffix) | **4** |

### Key Takeaways
- **LPS[i] can be equal to `i`, but never greater.**
- **The longest proper prefix-suffix is always shorter than `P[0:i+1]` itself.**
- **For repeating patterns like "aaaaa", LPS values increase sequentially because each prefix is also a suffix.**
